    "This project was severely limited by my time crunch, and I am disappointed that I can't present my best possible work to you. I was at a hackathon on Friday and Saturday nights, and came back at midnight on Sunday due to the late awards ceremony. Hence, I only had Monday night and one night the week prior to work on this. I spent the night learning everything I now know about data science and the statistical algorithms, and now have at least an elementary understanding of most of their functioning. I hope you see, even though this may not be my best work yet, that I am incredibly commmited and motivated to learn on the go, and I promise to work as hard as this, if not more, over the 4 months of the summer! \n",
